## 1. All inputs are mandatory

The Save button will be disabled until all inputs are filled correctly without any errors.

## 2. On submit populate the data in the table

On clicking the Save button, the data will be populated in the table below the form. Until there is no Data `No Data Available` text will be visible. Once we get at least one row in the table, the search box will be visible. and table with the requested formate will be visible.

## 3. Person's name and contact number should be unique, duplicate are not allowed.

If the user tries to enter the same name or contact number, an error message will be shown below the input field.

## 4. A little bit of styling is required

The form and table is responsive and look good.

## 5. Provide search by name

The search box will be visible once we get at least one row in the table. The search box will search the name in the table and show the result accordingly. It will auto search data once we start entering the name in the search box.

## 6. Provide delete functionality with alert

The delete button will be visible once we get at least one row in the table. On clicking the delete button, an alert will be shown to the user to confirm the delete action. If the user clicks on the cancel button, the delete action will be canceled. If the user clicks on the ok button, the delete action will be performed and the row will be deleted from the table.

## 7. Implement sort by name (When someone clicks on name column)

The sort button will be visible once we get at least one row in the table and when we hover on the name column header. On clicking the sort button, the data will be sorted in ascending order. If the user clicks on the sort button again, the data will be sorted in descending order. If user clicks again it will go to starting point.

## Note: One extra point will be given if the code supports data persistence (i.e. data should not be lost on page refresh)

The data will be stored in the local storage of the browser. So the data will not be lost on page refresh.
